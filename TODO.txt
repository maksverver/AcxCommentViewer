Nice-to-haves:

  - Cosmetic: editing a comment should update the edited-at timestamp.

  - Cosmetic: hide reply/delete/edit links after deleting a comment

  - Cosmetic: currently it's possible to collapse a comment and edit it or
        reply to it, which looks a little strange. Maybe I should disable
        edit/reply on a collapsed comment, and cancel the active edit/reply
        when the comment (or one of its ancestors!) is collapsed?

  - Smooth scrolling when changing focus with keyboard navigation?
        I experimented a bit with using scrollIntoView({behavior:'smooth'})
        but I didn't like the way it felt.

  - Also enable extension on comment pages?
        Kind of tricky because the full comment page for a post already contains
        the comments JSON baked in, so there doesn't seem to be a way to prevent
        the Substack code from running

Deferred to later/never:

  - Refresh button (incremental/full refresh?)
  - Highlight new comments (requires storing state)
  - Change tests to use node:test and node:assert (not much benefit)
  - Toggle to show/hide replies on a comment, without collapsing the comment itself
  - Compatibility with Firefox for Android
    https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/developing-extensions-for-firefox-for-android/
  - Extension options:
      - Date/time format (either short "May 5", full "May 5, 2024 at 11:45:12", or "x minutes ago"?)
      - Setting to collapse comments initially.
  - Render other metadata from the JSON:
    - "user_banned": true
    - "user_banned_for_comment": true
    - "author_on_other_pub": {}
    - "is_author": true
  - Collapse long comments (max-height: 600px), like Substack does.
